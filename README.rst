ODE for Marmalade
=================

This module can be used to build the Open Dynamics Library library into
Marmalade applications.

The source is downloaded and compiled unmodified from:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/opende/files/ode-0.11.1.tar.gz

The included example example.mkb will build the lib and run a simple demo. The
demo shows simple physics in a dynamic line animation.

The structure of this module shows how local modifications can be stored and
used with updated source distributions.  The upstream directory contents are
copied to the modified directory but without overwriting existing files.
